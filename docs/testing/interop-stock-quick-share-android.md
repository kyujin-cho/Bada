# Interop test runbook: stock Quick Share on Android

This is the manual interoperability test runbook for verifying that
WhenVivoMeetsGoogle (WVMG) can send to and receive from stock **Google
Quick Share** on Android, both on a clean Pixel (GMS) device and on a
Samsung One UI device with Samsung's forked Quick Share UI.

This runbook tracks issue
[#30](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/WhenVivoMeetsGoogle/issues/30) under
the [Phase 1 epic](https://github.com/kyujin-cho/WhenVivoMeetsGoogle/issues/1).

> **Phase 1 scope reminder.** Phase 1 is Wi-Fi LAN parity with NearDrop.
> BLE auto-trigger (the "ping nearby devices" pulse that lights up a
> stock receiver's "Sharing nearby" sheet automatically) is **out of
> scope** and is tracked under Phase 2. In Phase 1, the **only reliable
> path** to start a transfer to a stock Android device is the **QR-code
> path**: WVMG renders a QR code, the peer scans it with their camera,
> and stock Quick Share opens with our endpoint pre-selected. Discovery
> in the other direction (stock Android sends to WVMG) is also Wi-Fi-only
> in Phase 1: WVMG must already be advertising on mDNS for the peer's
> device picker to list us.

## Preconditions

### Networking requirements

Phase 1 uses Wi-Fi LAN discovery (mDNS), so both devices **must** be on
the same Wi-Fi network. BLE auto-discovery is Phase 2 and out of scope
for this runbook. The receiver's persistent notification surfaces the
current Wi-Fi SSID (`Receiving on "<SSID>"`) — use it to confirm both
ends match before you start each test.

### Network

- [ ] Both devices are on the **same Wi-Fi SSID and the same VLAN** —
      mDNS does not cross routed subnets.
- [ ] The Wi-Fi network has **mDNS / multicast traffic enabled**. Many
      enterprise / guest networks block multicast and silently break
      Quick Share. Use a phone hotspot if in doubt.
- [ ] Both devices have **Wi-Fi turned on**. Bluetooth is **not**
      required in Phase 1 (BLE pulse is Phase 2).
- [ ] Location permission is granted to Google Play Services on the
      stock device (Quick Share requires it for Wi-Fi scans).

### Devices under test (DUTs)

- [ ] **WVMG device:** Android device running the WVMG debug APK from
      `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`. `minSdk = 24`, but for this
      runbook prefer Android 12+ to match common test devices.
- [ ] **Stock Pixel peer:** A Pixel device with **clean GMS**, on a
      reasonably recent Android version (Android 13 / 14 / 15
      recommended; record the exact build fingerprint in the test log).
      Google Play services must be up to date — Quick Share rolls out
      via Play services, not via OS images.
- [ ] **Stock Samsung peer:** A Samsung Galaxy device with **One UI 6.0
      or newer** (One UI 6.x = Android 14, One UI 7.x = Android 15).
      Earlier One UI versions shipped Samsung's pre-merger "Quick
      Share" which is a different protocol; only the post-merger
      unified Quick Share is in scope.
- [ ] All devices on the same time zone / wall clock (UKEY2 doesn't
      strictly require synced clocks, but mDNS lease behavior is easier
      to reason about when wall clocks agree).

### Quick Share visibility on the stock peer

Set the stock peer's Quick Share visibility to one of these states for
each test, and record which:

- [ ] **"Everyone" / "Visible to everyone"** — easiest mode for testing.
      On Pixel: Settings → Connected devices → Connection preferences →
      Quick Share → "Everyone" (or the 10-minute toggle).
- [ ] **"Contacts"** — only works if the WVMG endpoint is treated as a
      contact, which it is **not** in Phase 1. Skip.
- [ ] **"Your devices"** — only works if both devices are signed in to
      the same Google account, which WVMG is not. Skip.

### WVMG configuration

- [ ] Receiver `ForegroundService` (`ReceiverForegroundService`) is
      running on the WVMG device — confirm via the persistent receiver
      notification.
- [ ] mDNS advertise is up. The TXT `n` record contains a valid packed
      `EndpointInfo` per
      [`core-protocol/.../endpoint/EndpointInfo.kt`](../../core-protocol/src/main/kotlin/io/github/kyujincho/wvmg/protocol/endpoint/EndpointInfo.kt).
- [ ] Service type is `_FC9F5ED42C8A._tcp.local.` (see
      [`core-protocol/.../ProtocolInfo.kt`](../../core-protocol/src/main/kotlin/io/github/kyujincho/wvmg/protocol/ProtocolInfo.kt)).
- [ ] Wi-Fi `MulticastLock` is held (validated via `adb shell dumpsys
      wifi | grep -i multicast` showing the WVMG package as a holder).

## Test matrix

Every cell in the matrix must be exercised once per RC build.

| # | Direction        | Peer    | Path used                | Visibility setting on peer | Result |
|---|------------------|---------|--------------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| 1 | WVMG -> Pixel    | Pixel   | QR code (Phase 1)        | Everyone                   |        |
| 2 | WVMG -> Samsung  | Samsung | QR code (Phase 1)        | Everyone                   |        |
| 3 | Pixel -> WVMG    | Pixel   | Pixel device picker      | n/a (sender side picks us) |        |
| 4 | Samsung -> WVMG  | Samsung | Samsung Quick Share UI   | n/a                        |        |

For each cell, run **both** a small file (≤ 1 MB, e.g. a JPEG) and a
large file (≥ 200 MB, e.g. a video). The large-file run is what catches
two-frame BYTES quirks and `IS_PENDING` MediaStore bleed bugs.

---

## Procedure

### Test 1 / Test 2: Send file from WVMG to a stock Android phone (QR-code path)

The QR path is the only Phase-1-supported path. Stock Android only
implements QR scanning as the receiver-side entry point — there is no
"manual IP entry" — so the flow below is mandatory.

- [ ] On the **stock peer**: open Settings → Connected devices →
      Connection preferences → Quick Share, and set visibility to
      **Everyone** (or use the temporary "Everyone for 10 minutes"
      toggle if available). Pull down the notification shade and
      confirm Quick Share is enabled.
- [ ] On the **WVMG device**: open the system share sheet for the file
      under test (e.g. long-press a photo in Files, share to WVMG).
      WVMG's `ShareIntentRouter`
      ([`app/.../send/ShareIntentRouter.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/io/github/kyujincho/wvmg/send/ShareIntentRouter.kt))
      should route the intent into `SendActivity`.
- [ ] In `SendActivity`, choose the **"Show QR code"** option. WVMG
      shows a QR rendered by `ShowQrActivity`
      ([`app/.../send/ShowQrActivity.kt`](../../app/src/main/kotlin/io/github/kyujincho/wvmg/send/ShowQrActivity.kt)).
- [ ] On the **stock peer**: open the **system camera app** (or Google
      Lens) and aim at the QR. Stock Quick Share intercepts the
      `https://qsr.gs/...` deep-link and opens the Quick Share receive
      sheet with our endpoint pre-selected.
- [ ] The peer taps **Accept** on its sheet.
- [ ] On the **WVMG device**: the consent / progress UI shows a
      4-digit PIN. The PIN must match what the peer displays.
- [ ] Wait for the transfer to complete. Note total wall-clock seconds.
- [ ] On the peer, locate the received file (typically in
      Downloads / "Quick Share" folder).
- [ ] Compute `sha256sum` of the source file on WVMG and the received
      file on the peer; **they must match**. Use `adb shell sha256sum
      /sdcard/Download/<file>` on each side, or `Termux` on the peer.

#### Things to record

- Android version + build number on each side
- Google Play services version on the peer (Settings → Apps → Google
  Play services → Version)
- Time-to-connect (QR scan → consent dialog visible)
- Time-to-complete (consent accepted → progress 100%)
- Source SHA-256, received SHA-256

### Test 3 / Test 4: Receive file from stock Android (peer initiates)

- [ ] On the **WVMG device**: confirm the receiver `ForegroundService`
      is running (persistent notification visible).
- [ ] On the **stock peer**: open **Google Files** (or any app with a
      shareable item) → Share → **Quick Share**.
- [ ] In the device picker, scroll until **the WVMG device's display
      name appears**. The name comes from the packed `EndpointInfo`
      (see preconditions). If the device does **not** appear within
      ~15 seconds, see the troubleshooting section below.
- [ ] Pick the WVMG device.
- [ ] On the **WVMG device**: a consent notification appears (handled
      by
      [`service-android/.../consent/ConsentNotification.kt`](../../service-android/src/main/kotlin/io/github/kyujincho/wvmg/service/receiver/consent/ConsentNotification.kt)).
      Tap "Accept" — or open the consent activity for the in-app
      experience.
- [ ] Confirm the 4-digit PIN matches between both devices.
- [ ] Wait for the transfer to complete.
- [ ] On the **WVMG device**, the file lands under **Downloads** via
      `MediaStoreDownloadsFactory`
      ([`service-android/.../downloads`](../../service-android/src/main/kotlin/io/github/kyujincho/wvmg/service/downloads)).
- [ ] `sha256sum` the source on the peer and the received file on
      WVMG. They **must match**.

#### Things to record

- Whether the WVMG device showed up in the picker on the **first**
  attempt (no need to toggle Wi-Fi, no need to restart Quick Share).
- The `IS_PENDING` state of the received MediaStore entry: it must be
  cleared (`IS_PENDING = 0`) by the time the transfer completes.

## Common Quick Share quirks

These are real-world quirks every tester should know about. None of
them are bugs in WVMG; they are properties of the stock Quick Share
UX. If a test step fails, walk this list before assuming a WVMG bug.

### Pixel / GMS quirks

- **"Visible to everyone" auto-disables after 10 minutes** on recent
  Android versions. If discovery worked once and now fails, re-enable
  it.
- **Quick Share is gated behind GMS being up to date.** A Pixel that
  has gone offline for weeks may be running an old Play services build
  whose Quick Share isn't compatible with current EndpointInfo
  format. Update via Play Store before retesting.
- **Battery saver disables Wi-Fi scans.** Ensure both devices have
  battery saver off.
- **Private DNS on "Strict" with a custom hostname** can interfere with
  mDNS resolution on some Pixel builds. Set Private DNS to "Automatic"
  for testing.
- The system camera's QR detection on Pixel sometimes refuses
  `https://qsr.gs/...` if Lens is disabled. Use the dedicated **Google
  Lens** app as a fallback.

### Samsung / One UI quirks

- **Samsung Quick Share has a "hidden" / "phone" / "no one" visibility
  layer** in the Quick Share quick-tile that is **separate** from the
  Android Settings page. Both must say "Everyone" — set them in the
  Quick Share quick-tile **and** in Settings.
- **One UI < 6.0** ships an older Samsung Quick Share that does **not**
  share a protocol with Google Quick Share. Verify the One UI version
  before debugging anything else.
- **Samsung's Galaxy Store auto-update** has been observed to roll
  Samsung Quick Share back to a Samsung-only build after a factory
  reset. Confirm the active Quick Share app is the Google one
  (`com.google.android.gms` / `com.google.android.apps.nbu.files` flow,
  not `com.samsung.android.app.sharelive`).
- Samsung devices aggressively kill background services. The receiver
  side of WVMG is a foreground service, but the Samsung peer's Quick
  Share may not be — if you can't see the WVMG device on Samsung's
  picker, **toggle Quick Share off and back on** to force a fresh
  scan.
- Samsung Knox DeX or Secure Folder profiles may have a separate Quick
  Share visibility setting; do testing on the main user profile only.

### Both

- Quick Share **caches the last-seen device list** for a few seconds.
  If you change WVMG's display name, restart Quick Share on the peer
  before re-checking.
- Quick Share is **picky about EndpointInfo length**. Names longer
  than ~63 UTF-8 bytes get truncated by some peers. Keep the WVMG
  device name short during interop.
- Some peers close the connection if the consent dialog isn't
  responded to within ~30 seconds. Don't let the WVMG device's screen
  lock during the consent step.

## What to log if a step fails

When any step above fails, capture **all** of the following before
filing a follow-up issue. The combination of these logs is what makes
Quick Share interop bugs reproducible.

### From the WVMG device

```bash
# Service + protocol logs from WVMG.
adb logcat -d \
    'wvmg:V' \
    'ReceiverForegroundService:V' \
    'ReceiverSession:V' \
    'OutboundConnection:V' \
    'InboundConnection:V' \
    'Discovery:V' \
    'QuickShareMdns:V' \
    'JmDNS:V' \
    'NsdManager:V' \
    'AndroidRuntime:E' \
    '*:S' > wvmg-logcat.txt

# Bug report (system-wide). Useful for Wi-Fi state, multicast lock holders.
adb bugreport wvmg-bugreport.zip

# Live multicast lock holders.
adb shell dumpsys wifi | grep -A2 -i multicast > wvmg-multicast.txt

# mDNS state visible to the OS.
adb shell dumpsys nsd > wvmg-nsd.txt
```

### From the stock peer

- Open Settings → System → Developer options → Bug report → Interactive
  report. Save the bug report and attach.
- For Pixel: Settings → Apps → Google Play services → "About this app"
  screenshot (so the Play services build is recorded).
- For Samsung: Settings → Apps → Quick Share → "About" screenshot. If
  Samsung's "Quick Share" appears to be missing, check Galaxy Store
  for updates and screenshot the version it lists.

### Network capture (optional but extremely useful)

- [ ] Run a Wi-Fi packet capture on a **third device** (laptop in
      monitor mode, or a router with `tcpdump`) for the duration of
      the failed transfer. Save as `failed-transfer.pcap`. Filter for
      `mdns or port 8080-65535` once captured.
- [ ] Note the timestamp of the failed step in the WVMG logcat to
      correlate against the pcap.

### File integrity

- [ ] If the file transferred but the SHA-256 mismatches, save **both**
      the source and the corrupted destination. Do **not** delete the
      destination — it is the primary evidence.

---

## Acceptance criteria for issue #30

- [ ] All 4 cells of the test matrix pass (small + large file each) on
      the current Phase 1 RC build.
- [ ] SHA-256 hashes match in every direction.
- [ ] Any new platform-specific quirks discovered get added to
      "Common Quick Share quirks" above and filed as follow-up issues
      (with `phase-1` or `phase-2` labels as appropriate).
